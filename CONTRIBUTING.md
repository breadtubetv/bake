# Contributing

Thank you so much for helping us build [BreadTube.tv](https://BreadTube.tv), an open source media distribution platform for simplifying the sharing of the massively important content coming out of the BreadTube movement.

We're looking for any help you can offer, including but not limited to advising us on what playlists we should put together.

If you're a creator we really want to know what information you would like on here, and also if you would like your own free and open source version of the platform, eg [yourchannel.breadtube.tv](#contributing) or [yourchannel.tv](#contributing) _(all hosting costs will be covered by donors)_.

[README](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/#breadtubetv) is the first place to go to learn everything about the project.

[The Issues](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/issues) section is a great place to add ideas about expanding the platform

You can also visit [BreadTube.tv](https://breadtube.tv) to find other platforms where this content is being distributed.

## Development

### Creating a Playlist

- [Create a New File](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/new/master/content/playlists) under [content/playlists/](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/tree/master/content/playlists) (ProTip: [Copy an existing one](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/blob/master/content/playlists/welcome.md))
- Add the video ids you want into the new [Playlist Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/)
- Add the videos you need to [`data/videos.yml`](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/blob/master/data/videos.yml)
- Add the channels you need to [`data/channels.yml`](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/blob/master/data/channels.yml)

Thank you.
